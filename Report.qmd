#| fig-alt: "The figure shows an overall positive average difference in college softball and baseball expenses of between 100,000 and 200,000 dollars for California colleges from 2015 to 2019. The average difference appears to change at a relatively constant rate over time, slightly increasing from 2015 to 2018 and then decreasing from 2018 to 2019. The shaded region, representing adding and subtracting 2 standard errors from the average difference, seems to be around 100,000 dollars wide."
#| fig-cap: "Above entails an analysis of the average differences in expenses from 2015 to 2019 for collegiate baseball and softball in California. The average difference in expenses for a particular year for all California teams is plotted as a blue circle. The pink highlighted region represents adding or subtracting two standard errors of the average difference from the plotted average differences. This shaded region therefore represents a roughly 95% confidence interval for the true average difference for all collegiate baseball and softball teams in California between 2015 to 2019 that meet the conditions required for data collection. The average difference in expenses are consistantly greater than 0 along with the interval for said average differences, meaning the average expenses for baseball are consistantly signifigantly larger than the expenses for softball."
